# Python Project

As part of a technical test I needed to perform this project which I learned through its development. 

The subject and enquiries are included in the project but real data has not been uploaded, instead invented data has been created. 

Some files have been created to mock the cases of having invalid files as input and files with invalid data to test with the logging module included in each function.

Additionally, a file test_flights.py has been created to make testing easier with pytest. The test_flights.py includes the functions to test, as well as the test functions without comments. All explanations and clarifications are included in the jupyter notebook with the goal of making this project more didactic.

Later on, the command on the terminal pytest test_flights.py will run the testing.

Enjoy :D
