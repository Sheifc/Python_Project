# Python Project

<div style="text-align: justify;">
As part of a technical test, I needed to work on this project, which I learned through its development. The project has been executed using a Jupyter Notebook named "flights.ipynb," chosen for didactic purposes.

The subject and inquiries are included in the project, but real data has not been uploaded; instead, invented data has been created.

To mock different scenarios, some files have been generated to represent cases with invalid input files and files containing invalid data. These files are used for testing purposes by the logging module which has been included in each function.

Additionally, a file named "test_flights.py" has been created to facilitate testing with pytest. "test_flights.py" includes the test functions without comments, as well as the functions to be tested. All explanations and clarifications are provided in the Jupyter Notebook to enhance the didactic nature of this project.

To run the testing, you can execute the command "pytest test_flights.py" in the terminal.

Enjoy :D
